# Fast Fourier Transform using gezel

Since the age of the electronics fast fourier transform has changed our world.  
Impelementing it using a hardware in parallel to software enables us to make it more efficient. Hence this repo gives us a good glimpse on how the modern world uses this algorithm to make music, images and ... transmitted.  

## To see the implementation runing
Simply run the `./run.sh` through a 32 bit compatible linux system containing `gezel` tool and `arm-linux-gcc`.
